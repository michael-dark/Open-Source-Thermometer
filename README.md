# Open-Source-Thermometer
This project is to develop an open-source hardware and software solution for an internet-connected thermometer. Specifically, this is designed to log data to an SD card as well as send to an InfluxDB database (https://www.influxdata.com). This supports up to four thermocouples, as well as measuring room temperature and relative humidity.
